Additionally, the spells and sources for the spells, are the property of Wizards
of the Coast.  No ownership is claimed over that material, nor is permission implied
or explicitly given for its use.  To the best of my knowledge, this spells list is
for personal use, and individuals most already own a physical copy of the source materials.
