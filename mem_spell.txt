Description| This spell afflicts any single creature of large size or smaller the caster can see within range. The creature is automatically stunned (reeling, unable to think or act coherently) for the following round, and must make five Constitution checks (save vs. death magic for monsters without a Constitution score}. For each one failed. a limb is broken, with an accompanying ld6+2 points of damage and loss of mobility. For human, demihuman, and humanoid. the checks are for left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg, and neck; if the last one fails, a system shock survival roll is required to avoid death. (DMs must rule on a reduction in movement rate appropriate for the creature if one or more limbs that provide movement are broken; a reduction by half for a bipedal creature, for example).\n\nA wizard of 18th level can affect huge creatures; one of 25th can affect gargantuan creatures.\n\nThe material component for this spell is a bone, which is broken during the spellcasting. Chicken bones are often used.\n\nNotes: Restricted to the Seven Sisters, their apprentices, and select Harpers; rare.

Name: Fly
Class: ["Wizard"]
School: ["Alteration"]
Level: 3 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S, M 
Casting Time: 3 
Duration: 1 turn/level + ld6 turns 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 
Description| This spell enables the wizard to bestow the power of magical flight. The creature affected is able to move vertically and horizontally at a rate of 18 {half that if ascending, twice that if descending in a dive). The maneuverability class of the creature is B (180 degrees or less of turning in a round). Using the fly spell requires as much concentration as walking, so most spells can be cast while hovering or moving slowly (movement of 3). Possible combat penalties while flying are known to the DM (found in the 'Aerial Combat' section of Chapter 9 of the DMG). The exact duration of the spell is always unknown to the spellcaster, as the variable addition is determined secretly by the DM.\n\nThe material component of the fly spell is a wing feather of any bird.\n\nNotes: Common spell (PHB).

Name: Forcecage
Class: ["Wizard"]
School: ["Evocation", "Force"]
Level: 7 
Range: 10 yds./2 levels 
Components: ["V", "S", "special"] 
Casting Time: 3-4 
Duration: 6 turns + 1/level 
Area of Effect: 20-ft. cube 
Saving Throw: None 
Description| This powerful spell enables the caster to bring into being a cube of force, but it is unlike the magical item of that name in one important respect: Instead of solid walls of force the forcecage has alternating bands of force with ½­inch gaps between. Thus, it is truly a cage, rather than an enclosed space with solid walls. Creatures within the area of effect of the spell are caught and contained unless they are able to pass through the openings-and, of course, all spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars of force of the forcecage.\n\nA creature with magic resistance has a single attempt to pass through the walls of the cage. If the resistance check is successful, the creature escapes. If it fails, the creature is caged. Note that a successful check docs not destroy the cage, nor does it enable other creatures (save familiars) to flee with the escaping creature. The forcecage is also unlike the solid-walled protective device, cube of force, in that it can be gotten rid of only by means of a dispel magic spelJ or by the expiration of the spell.\n\nBy means of speciaJ preparation at the time of memorization, a forcecage spell can be altered to aforcec11be spell. The cube created is IO feet on a side. and the spell then resembles that of a cube of force in all respects save that of the differences between a cast spell and the magic of a device, including the methods of defeating its power.\n\nAlthough the actual casting of either application of the spell requires no material component, the study required to commit it to memory does demand that the wizard powder a diamond of at least 1,000 gp value, using the diamond dust to trace the outlines of the cage or cube he desires to create via spelJcasting at some later time. Thus. in memorization, the diamond dust is employed and expended, for upon completion of study, the wizard must then toss the dust into the air and ii will disappear.\n\nNotes: Common spell (PHB).

Name: Forest's Fiery Constrictor
Class: ["Wizard"]
School: ["Conjuration", "Summoning", "Fire"]
Level: 6 
Range: 10 yds./level
Components: V, S, M
Casting Time: 6 
Duration: 1 rd./level 
Area of Effect: 1 fire source
Saving Throw: Special
Description| This spell causes a tentacle of magical flame to snake forth from any existing source of natural or magical fire. The flaming tendril is 10 feet long, has AC 7, can be hit only by magical weapons of +2 or better enchantment, and bas bit points equal to double I.be caster's level (24 hit points for a 12th-level caster).\n\nAny creature within 20 feet of the tentacle is subject to attack as directed by the caster. The victim must al1empt a saving throw vs. spell. If successful, the subject only suffers ld6 points of fire damage from contact with the tendril. If the saving throw is failed, the victim is entangled and suffers 3d6 points of fire damage each round until the tendril is destroyed or the spell expires.\n\nIf the fire source from which the tentacle emanates is extinguished, the remaining time that the fiery constrictor can exist is cut in half.\n\nThe material component is a red dragon's scale.\n\nNotes: Uncommon spell (ToM).

Duration: Instantaneous 
Area of Effect: The caster 
Saving Throw: None 
Description| This spell allows the caster to immediately teleport without error to the location of a specially enchanted gem. The teleport will always be on target (never high or low). If the area the gem is in is too confined, the caster will appear in the nearest sufficiently large space. This transport is one-way, and the spellcaster cannot jump back to his initial location by use of this spell.\n\nThis spell is initially cast upon a special gem known as a rog11esto11e. The roguestone is not destroyed in the initial casting or subsequent activation of the spell. At any time after the stone is enchanted, by uttering a command word. the caster can immediately teleport to the location of the gem. The caster can use the roguestone to gemjump any time after the initial casting.\n\nThere is no time limit, and the caster can be slain, resurrected, rei11carnated, shapechanged, or become undead and still he able to use the roguestone to gemjump. Gemjumping requires only the uttering of a word, whether the caster is in chains or otherwise bound, or within a magical entrapment such as a force cage. The caster can be on a different plane or planet than the stone and still have it function. The caster cannot use the command word if feebleminded, asleep, unconscious, petrified, paralyzed, or insane, nor will the gemjump operate if the caster or the roguestone is within an ant/magic shell. Only the caster and his normal clothing will be trans­ported; any chains, equipment, or allies will be left behind.\n\nThe roguestone itself radiates no detectable magical energy unless it is in the process of gemjumping. Multiple gemjumps can be case on a single roguestone by separate wizards. These additional spells do not negate 1he previous gemjumps on the roguestone. A limited wish will reveal the number (though not the identity) of gemjumps cast on a rogues1one. Only a full wish will dispel those magics on a roguestone. Physical destruction of t.he roguestone will also destroy the magic, though spellcasters who have links with a roguestone will be aware of its destruction. The roguestone saves as rock crystal.\n\nNotes: Uncommon spell. Known to be in Elminster's Traveling Spell book.

Name: Ghost Rigging
Class: ["Wizard"]
School: ["Conjuration", "Summoning", "Wind"]
Level: 4 
Range: 120 yds. 
Components: V, S, M 
Casting Time: 4 
Duration: l hr./level 
Area of Effect: 1 vessel 
Saving Throw: None
Description| Used primarily at sea, This magic creates a "ghostly" rigging on a ship or other vessel, which functions just as normal rigging does. Sorcerers typically use the spell to replace damaged sails or masts that have snapped-especially when the crew is no longer sufficient to rig the ship by other means.\n\nThe rigging always matches the vessel's needs. Thus, an unmasted galleon gains three masts, each with a billowing set of sails. A raft or barge acquires a single sail, sufficient to help it on its way. The vessel moves normally for its type.\n\nThe conjured rigging performs as normal rigging in all ways-even in combat. It is vulnerable to damage just as normal rigging would be. Further, a successful dispel magic or similar spell can destroy it.\n\nThe rigging is translucent and glows dimly; sails provide a soft radiance even at night. The caster can place a personal symbol on the sails to advertise his presence. For instance, one sorcerer­pirate creates sails that resemble screaming faces, appearing and disappearing as the wind catches the ghostly fabric.\n\nThe material components of this spell are a bit of canvas and string. When the spell is cast, the components expand and change to become the ghostly rigging.\n\nNotes: Common in Arabian settings; otherwise very rare.

Name: Ghostgrail
Class: ["Wizard"]

Casting Time: 6 
Duration: I rdJlevel 
Area of Effect: Creature touched 
Saving Throw: None 
Description| This spell affects the caster or a single creature: touched during spellcasting. It makes the recipient immune to all undead special powers (level or Strength draining, fear, mummy rot, and the like), so that the protected being suffers only physical damage from undead attacks. A wizard under the effects of a ghostgrail does not age when encountering a ghost and need not make a saving throw when hearing a banshee wail.\n\nMoreover, the spell allows the protected being to see, hit, and damage undead with normal weapons (shadows are always seen, vampires can be struck when gaseous, and so on). This temporarily overrides undead immunities, but also negates any special bonuses the recipient receives against undead (for example, a mace of disruption wielded by the recipient would not blast undead out of existence). A ghostgrail spell does not negate spell-like undead powers, such as phasing or flying, and does not provide any protection against spells cast by undead, such as a spell cast by a lich.\n\nThe material component of the ghostgrail spell is the dust from a coffin or burial slab.\n\nNotes: Rare in the FORGOTTEN REALMS setting; virtually unknown elsewhere.

Casting Time: 8 
Duration: Instantaneous 
Area of Effect: 1 undead creature 
Saving Throw: Neg. 
Description| This powerful high magic spell bas an effect unlike any other. It restores undead creatures to life. Undead creatures are allowed a saving throw vs. death magic, but they can only make such a roll at a level equal to half their Hit Dice. An 18th-level lich, for example, would make a saving throw vs. death magic as if it were actually a 9th-level wizard.\n\nIf the undead creature fails its saving throw, it is immediately restored to life as it was just before its death, if it died by unnatural causes. It is restored to life as it was 10 years before its death if it died of old age or similar causes. The restored creature is stunned and incapable of any action for ld4 turns as it slowly realizes what happened.\n\nThe restored creature returns to life at an appropriate experience and Hie Die level, and with its original alignment and abilities. 1t will, however, be wearing the same clothes, and carrying whatever equipment (if any) that it did as an undead creature.\n\nThis spell does not necessarily change the alignment of a creature who was originally eviJ, but the elves recount legends of wicked liches or vampires who were restored through this spell, repented their old lives, and changed alignment, dedicating themselves ro the defense of elves.\n\nThe material component of this spell is a gold medallion in the form of the sun (worth at least 500 gp).\n\nNotes: Restricted to elves able to cast High Magic, such as those of Evermeet.

Description| This spell creates an immobile, faintly shim, meting, magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, or 4th-level spell effects from penetrating. Thus, the area of effect of any such spell does not include the area of the globe of invulnerability. This includes innate spell-like abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere; spells pass from the caster of the globe to the subject without effect on the globe. Fifth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe.
